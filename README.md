# Evolution
## Introduction
The goal of this repository project is to simulate a growth in population using a genetic self adapting algorithm. The starting point of this is creating a population with N humans. Once the population is grown, set a gene for each person in the population. We want to adapt and grow the population cutting out the weakest members of society and having our algorithm understand that in the evolution of people that have stronger genes than others.
